My final project was a simple Space Invaders game. The game starts as soon as the program is run. Use the left and right arrow keys
to move and the space bar to shoot. 
Most of the functions use selection - a lot of if-else statements.
The invaders are stored in an array. Each function goes through the array to: move the invaders, calculate collision and drop bombs.
