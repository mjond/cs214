# split.rb splits a string into two substrings.
#
# Input: A string and an integer string position to split the string by.
# Precondition: The position integer is within the range of the string size.
# Output: The substrings aString(0, position - 1) and
#   aString(pos, length() - 1).

# split() splits a string into its two substrings.
# Receive: aString, the string to be split,       
#        pos, the split position.                  
# PRE: 0 <= pos < the length of aString.
# Return: the substring of aString before pos, and  
#         the substring of aString from pos onwards.
